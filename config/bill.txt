National Grid Resilience and Clean Storage Act

A bill to modernize the national electric grid, expand battery storage capacity, and harden critical infrastructure against extreme weather. The bill authorizes a mix of grants, tax incentives, and loan guarantees for state-level grid upgrades, prioritizing underserved regions and high-risk corridors. It also establishes a national resilience scorecard, requires annual reporting, and sets targets for reducing outage durations.
